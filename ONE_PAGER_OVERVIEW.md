# Family Hub App - One-Page Overview

## What We Built

A smart family management app that makes meal planning, shopping, and activity coordination effortless. Parents can get AI-powered meal suggestions, automatically generate shopping lists, and keep track of family activities - all in one place.

## Key Functionalities & Why We Made Them

### 1. Smart Meal Planning with AI
**What it does:** Uses Google's Gemini AI to suggest meals based on your family's dietary needs and preferences.
**Why we chose this:** Eliminates the daily "what's for dinner?" struggle. The AI considers allergies, favorite cuisines, and dietary restrictions to make personalized suggestions that actually work for your family.

### 2. Family Role Management
**What it does:** Different access levels for Parents, Cooks, and Children with special profiles for kids.
**Why we chose this:** Real families have different responsibilities. Parents plan, cooks execute, and children participate. Kids get special treatment with birth dates instead of email addresses and fun visual indicators.

### 3. Auto-Generated Shopping Lists
**What it does:** Automatically creates organized shopping lists from your planned meals with smart categorization.
**Why we chose this:** Shopping becomes effortless when the app does the thinking. No more forgotten ingredients or wandering around the store wondering what you needed.

### 4. Activity Coordination
**What it does:** Schedule and assign family activities with a simple calendar view.
**Why we chose this:** Busy families need coordination. Parents can assign tasks and activities to specific family members, keeping everyone on the same page.
